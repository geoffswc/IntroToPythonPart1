### Intro To Python Part 1

This repository contains workshop notebooks, notes, exercises, and responses to questions during the UCSF Library DSI Intro to Python Part 1 workshop.

### Order of Notebooks

Although these notebooks are named by chapter, they are intended to be followed in a slightly different order as we introduce conditionals in the single variable case before moving on to lists and loops, then return to conditionals in loops at the end of the series. 

1. CH2_Variables+assignments.ipynb
2. CH3_Data_Types+Type_Conversion.ipynb
3. CH4_Built-in_Functions+Help.ipynb
4. CH5_Libraries.ipynb
5. CH13_Conditionals.ipynb
6. CH10_Lists.ipynb
7. CH12-Loops.ipynb

### Links
